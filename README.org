* =eshell-z=
** Introduction
The =eshell-z= package is an Emacs port of [[https://github.com/rupa/z][z]].
It keeps track of where youâ€™ve been and how many commands you invoke there,
and provides a convenient way to jump to the directories you actually
use. =eshell-z= and =z= can work together by sharing the same data file.

=eshell-z= provides a new command =eshell/z= for cd to frequent directory in
eshell.

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC
~ $ z -h
usage: z [-rtlxh] [regex1 regex2 ... regexn]

    -r, --rank           match by rank only
    -t, --time           match by recent access only
    -l, --list           list only
    -x, --delete         remove the current directory from the datafile
    -h, --help           show a brief help message

examples:

    z foo         cd to most frecent dir matching foo
    z foo bar     cd to most frecent dir matching foo, then bar
    z -r foo      cd to highest ranked dir matching foo
    z -t foo      cd to most recently accessed dir matching foo
    z -l foo      list all dirs matching foo (by frecency)
